- Run the patch from any location you want or from the install location (optional).
- If the "Detect Install" option is ENABLED (by default), the patcher will try to detect the 
install location of the target products and patch all the files, without you having to specify a 
location.
- If the detection fails or the option is DISABLED, the patcher will try to use the current 
directory if its valid. Otherwise, it will ask you to select the correct folder.

TIP: The "Detect Install" option is also useful when you have multiple installs of the target 
products (editions/platforms) and you want to patch them all in one shot.

In almost all my releases you will find a main menu. This menu can be opened by cliking the little
button with three lines (at top-left corner of the window). Among the options shown here, the two
most important are:

⦁ News & Announcements: This option will check if there is any important announcement that I want to
  share with the community. Generally, these announcements are also posted on the website.

⦁ Check for Updates: This option will check if an update of this release is available. If there is
  one, it will show information about the release and will give you the chance to download it
  directly. Normally any new version of this release will be posted on the website, with the
  exception of some cases in which I cannot publicly post such releases for "legal" reasons. In
  those cases, using this option is the only way to get a new version.

NOTE: These options require Internet access and will only connect to the net when selected. In case
      you have a firewall, probably you will need to make an exception.               

Some antivirus can detect this release as a threat and try to remove it. The reason for this is
because my releases are packed/protected in order to reduce its size and avoid alterations to the
code. This protection can be erroneously identified as a threat, it is what is commonly known as a
FALSE POSITIVE. Just ignore it, it is safe to use.

IMPORTANT: there will be no risk when using my releases as long as you have downloaded it from the
links posted on my site or from the "Check for Updates" option. If you have downloaded this release
from another site, I CANNOT GUARANTEE ITS INTEGRITY. In such case, I will not take responsability
for eventual problems that arise when using it. Be careful!

As a precaution, always check the release hash.
